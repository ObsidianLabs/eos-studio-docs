a unified application, EOS Studio provides a powerful and easy-to-use 
environment to build dApps. 
With EOS Studio, developers can complete the whole dApp development process
from.

The key features include

- Built-in EOSIO.CDT

EOS Studio was first launched in Febuary 2019 and it 
quickly became the fastest and most powerful tool for EOSIO contract development.
Prior to EOS Studio, developers needed to use the command line and learn multiple
tools for contract compilation, deployment and test. Although these tools have 
provided important operability at the fundamental levels, they were not designed 
for efficiency.

EOS Studio aim to provide a powerful and easy-to-use environment for dApp development.
It not only supports basic IDE features such as code editing, but also integrates 
components for blockchain development.
