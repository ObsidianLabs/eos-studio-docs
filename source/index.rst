EOS Studio (`<https://www.eosstudio.io>`_) is a graphical IDE for EOSIO dApp development.
It was first launched in Febuary 2019 and quickly became the most popular tool for EOSIO, 
attracting thousands of EOSIO developers worldwide. 
At present, EOS Studio comes in two versions: a :doc:`desktop version <getting-started/desktop>` 
that supports Mac OS, Windows and Linux operating systems, as well as a :doc:`web version <getting-started/web>`
that allows dApp development in a browser.

By integrating various tools required for EOSIO in a unified application,
EOS Studio aims to provide a powerful and easy-to-use environment for dApp development.
With EOS Studio, developers can complete the entire dApp development process in a single application.
The key features of EOS Studio include

- C++ code editor with EOSIO syntax highlighting
- Built-in EOSIO.CDT and :ref:`cloud CDT`
- Interactive :doc:`Contract Inspector </eos-studio/contract>`
- Version manager for EOSIO software

This documentation will introduce how to use EOS Studio for dapp development, 
explain the functions of each module of EOS Studio, 
and also present some high-quality EOSIO smart contracts.
