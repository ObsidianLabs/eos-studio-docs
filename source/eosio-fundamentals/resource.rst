Resources
===========================================

The EOSIO blockchain defines three types of resources to
compensate the usage of the network:

- CPU for computation time
- NET for network bandwidth
- RAM for data storage

..

  Since these three resources are all limited, the EOSIO network
  designed models to distribute them and ...

CPU
===========================================


When an account calls any contract, it is calculated and consumes CPU. 
A certain amount of EOS needs to be mortgaged in exchange for CPU usage rights.
The network will prorate the CPU time that each account can use based 
on the total amount of CPUs collateralized on all accounts.  This time
Represents the total CPU length that can be used in 24 hours. 
The more CPUs an account needs to use, the more it needs to

Delegated EOS can be refunded. It takes 72 hours.

NET
===========================================

NET's distribution mechanism is the same as the CPU, 
but also through the mortgage method.
To allocate the use of network bandwidth.

RAM
===========================================

The total amount of storage space on the chain is limited, 
so storing data requires buying RAM.
RAM needs to be purchased and the price is automatically adjusted 
by the bancor algorithm.
The more people you buy, the higher the RAM price, and vice versa.

REX
===========================================

If an account need to use a large amount of CPU or NET for
a short period of time, it needs to stake a huge amount of EOS token.
