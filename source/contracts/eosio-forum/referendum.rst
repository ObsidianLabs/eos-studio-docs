EOSIO Referendum
===========================================

.. note::

  This is a section to explain why we need a referendum system in EOSIO
  and how they are used to organize the community-governed blockchain.

  Possible points we need to cover

  - Why we need a referendum system
  - How EOS Canada implemented the ``eosio.forum`` smart contract (some history background)
  - How the ``eosio.forum`` contract is used on the mainnet and where to look at current proposals
  - How the same contract is used in side-chains
  - Other possible use cases of the ``eosio.forum`` contract (as a voting system, in DAC or DAO, etc)
  - Some other things worth mentioning here
