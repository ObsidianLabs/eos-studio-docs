Getting Started
===========================================

EOS Studio is available in two versions. Developers are welcome to choose either one 
that better fits their purpose in development.


- :doc:`EOS Studio Desktop <desktop>` 
  is a stand-alone desktop appliction that supports
  Mac OS, Windows and Linux operating systems. 
  It will also help you install and manage other tools 
  required in the development,
  including `EOSIO <https://github.com/EOSIO/eos>`_ and 
  `EOSIO.CDT <https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio.cdt>`_.

- :doc:`EOS Studio Web <web>`
  is a complete IDE that runs entirely in the browser. 
  Developers can open a link and start dApp development 
  immediately without any pre-installation. 
  Meanwhile, the :ref:`cloud CDT` and cloud-based network ensure
  that EOS Studio Web can provide complete dApp development capabilities.

In the following sections, we will demonstrate how to use both versions to
create, build, deploy, and execute a smart contract. You will be able to learn 
their difference and choose the appropriate one for your purposes.
